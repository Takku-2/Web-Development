  <h2>Display tech</h2>
  <p id="change">A display is a computer output surface and projecting mechanism that shows text.It’s no secret that we live in a screen-focused society. Smartphones, tablets, laptops, televisions, and even some advertisements such as those found in
    shopping
    centres all use display technology. Everyone is likely to encounter some form of display each day.
    Our daily exposure to screens means we often take this technology for granted, but they do not all use the same components; rather, different types of display technologies are used depending on the purpose of the display. Here’s an
    introduction
    to the different types of display technology.

  <h3>Eye protection</h3>
  <p id="change1">
    Researchers are continually releasing studies on the potential harm of blue light filters. When you stare at a screen all day and into the evening, it can affect your sleep and disrupt your body’s natural rhythms. For these reasons, blue
    light
    filters are incredibly important.
    This is why there is a blue light filter on your devices you just need to check the settings.
  </p>
  <h3>What’s the problem with blue light?</h3>
  <p id="change2">
    The reason blue light hurts is purely biological. Sleep is a part of the circadian rhythm, which is the cycle of biological processes that are determined in part by the levels of light and dark exposed to our bodies.
    In the most natural setting, which is one where we’re only exposed to sunlight, our retinas sense when the sun descends and the environment grows darker. That induces our hypothalamus to start the process of producing melatonin and other
    sleep
    hormones and reducing our body temperature.
    When we use artificial lighting to extend our day, however, our bodies get confused and the various sleep signals are disrupted. Even worse is the blue light emitted by fluorescent and LED lights — like those on our various device displays —
    which cause us to be more alert and produce even less melatonin.
    That’s why using a blue light filter is so important.

  <h3>Type of Display</h3>
  <div class="bigp" id="change3">
    <p id="change3">
    <h4>LCD (liquid crystal display)</h4>
    LCDs are often used for television screens and computer monitors. They are made from several layers; a layer of liquid crystal is pressed between a sheet of glass substrate formed with transparent pixel electrodes and TFTs (thin-film
    transistors) and a sheet of substrate with a colour filter and transparent counter electrodes. LCD technology doesn’t emit light, rather it blocks light to create a picture on the screen, so they need a source of backlighting.

    TVs originally used CCFLs (cold cathode fluorescent lamps) for their backlighting. However, because LED technology is now superior in terms of brightness output, compactness, and energy efficiency, modern LCD screens use LEDs for their
    backlighting.



    <h4>LED (light-emitting diode), OLED (organic light emitting-diode) and AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode)</h4>
    LED screens are composed of many LEDs placed close together to form a display panel. The LEDs in these displays usually emit only three colours, (red, green and blue) but these can be combined to make most colours in the visible spectrum.

    OLEDs are the next generation of technology to be used in place of LCD and regular LED displays. AMOLEDs are even more advanced, using active-matrix technology to provide a superior picture – these are used in smartphone displays.

    LED screens can be used for any kind of display, such as signs or any outdoor screens. They will use less energy to operate, whilst still being extremely bright and retaining a high picture quality and clarity. Large display screens such as
    those found in Times Square and Piccadilly Circus use LED displays because they do not get washed out by ambient light. Because of the panel makeup of LED displays, the size of screens can be increased without compromising on picture quality.



    <h4>ELD (electroluminescent display)</h4>
    Electroluminescent displays are flat panel technologies that are created by a layer of electroluminescent material pressed between two layers of conductors. When a current flows through the display, the electroluminescent material produces
    radiation that appears as visible light. Electroluminescent displays can be paper-thin and operate in more extreme temperatures than other light sources.

    ELDs are typically used for the displays in automobiles and on audio devices and to illuminate keypads and watch dials, as well as larger applications such as graphics on bus stops, reception desks and vending machines.



    <h4>PDP (plasma display panels)</h4>
    Plasma displays use plasma, an electronically-charged ionized gas, to create a picture. Plasma displays originally replaced CRT (cathode ray tube) TVs because the sets could be made much thinner. Plasma displays often have a wider viewing
    angle, brighter colours and deeper blacks than those provided by LCDs.

    Plasma displays aren’t seen much anymore; they were once the best type of display available when it came to TV sets but have since been outstripped significantly for that purpose by OLEDs.



    <h4>QLED (quantum dot light emitting diode)</h4>
    QLED technology uses a metallic quantum dot filter to enhance colour and contrast. This dot filter is a film of crystal semiconductor particles that replaces the RGB filters used in older TVs and can be controlled to change their colour
    output.
    Currently, QLEDs can produce the highest level of brightness, the largest colour palette, and the purest whites.
    Whilst the quantum dot filter technology is new to the world of screens, this type of display is an advancement on existing LED/LCD tech, and still requires the use of backlighting. Therefore, the main competitor for QLED is OLED, which
    produces its own light.
    There are a lot of bold claims about what type of display gives the ‘best picture quality’ but a lot of it depends on what you are manufacturing. Hopefully, this introduction to the types of display technology has been useful in understanding
    the differences.

    Displays aren’t static. Content and motion appears smooth on your phone’s screen because every pixel updates to display the latest content from your handset’s processor. But this doesn’t happen randomly. Panels update their content at regular
    intervals, known as the refresh rate.
    The refresh rate measures how quickly the phone’s display updates. In other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every
    second
    it is on. A 60Hz display refreshes 60 times per second, 90Hz is 90 times per second, and 120Hz is 120 times per second. So a 120Hz display refreshes twice as fast as a 60Hz panel, and 4x faster than an old 30Hz TV.
    Faster update times also mean lower latency, because the pixels are being refreshed more often. For example, it takes 16.6 ms to fully refresh a 60Hz display, 11.1ms for 90Hz, and just 8.3ms for a 120Hz rate. Refresh rate isn’t the only
    factor
    in round-trip display latency, but it’s the largest contributor.
    Your smartphone’s screen doesn’t refresh all at once each cycle though. Instead, each horizontal row of pixels refreshes in turn until the whole display updates at the required rate. You can see this in action if you film a display in slow
    motion and it’s the reason why displays flicker if you view them through your smartphone camera’s viewfinder. In other words, your display is constantly updating and refreshing, but it takes the cycle time to complete one full refresh.
    If you’re interested in seeing how frame rates affect smoothness and motion blur yourself, check out this demo.
    A quick note on touch sample rate, a related but different metric. Also measured in Hz, the sample rate tells you how many times per second the touchscreen looks for input from the user’s finger. A higher touch sample rate means less lag
    between input (touch or swipe) and action, which is especially important for fast-paced games.
